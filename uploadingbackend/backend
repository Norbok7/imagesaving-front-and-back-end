# We will start off by running the following command to add Active Storage to our Ruby on Rails API:
rails active_storage:install
rails db:migrate


# Include active storage tables mean that we can now attach files to Active Record models. We can simply do this by adding the following line to the model:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :image
end
has_one_attached :image
